Working with cutting-edge technology and using that to create innovative solutions (often before the technology has commoditized) is what I like most.

My biggest strength is that I'm able to automate almost anything (PowerShell). I transitioned from a traditional infrastructure role (AD, Exchange) to a role where I spend most of my time just being busy with awesome tech (like Docker, Kubernetes and Helm), engineering CICD frameworks (GitHub, Azure DevOps), implementing GitOps, work in the Cloud space (Azure / AWS) and develop (micro-) services (C#, Azure Functions, Containerization). It's a great time to be in IT!
